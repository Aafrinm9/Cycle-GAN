# GAN
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a type of neural network architecture used for generative modeling, meaning they can generate new data similar to the data they were trained on. GANs consist of two competing networks:

Generator: Creates fake data similar to the real data.
Discriminator: Evaluates data to determine if it is real or generated (fake).
The two networks compete: the generator tries to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to create increasingly realistic data.

## Cycle GAN 
CycleGAN is a type of GAN designed for unpaired image-to-image translation. Unlike standard GANs, which require paired data, CycleGAN works well even without having matching image pairs from the two domains. It learns to translate an image from one domain to another (e.g., horse to zebra) while preserving the key characteristics and structure of the original image.

Key Features of CycleGAN:

Two Generators: CycleGAN has two generators: G (e.g., Horse → Zebra) and F (e.g., Zebra → Horse).
Two Discriminators: Each generator has a corresponding discriminator that checks the authenticity of the generated images.
Cycle Consistency Loss: To ensure that the generated images retain characteristics of the original, CycleGAN uses a cycle consistency loss. This means that if an image is transformed to another domain and then back again, it should look like the original. For example:
An image of a horse generated into a zebra by G should look like the original horse if it is transformed back by F.
How CycleGAN Works:
Domain Translation:
Generator G translates an image from Domain A to Domain B (e.g., Horse to Zebra).
Generator F translates an image from Domain B to Domain A (e.g., Zebra to Horse).
Adversarial Training:
The discriminators try to distinguish real images in each domain from generated ones.
The generators try to fool the discriminators, making their generated images as realistic as possible.
### Cycle Consistency:
Image A is translated to B' using G.
Image B' is then translated back to A' using F.
The cycle consistency loss ensures that A' is similar to the original A, encouraging the network to retain features and avoid drastic changes.

### Applications:
1. CycleGAN can be used for artistic style transfer, such as converting images to look like they were painted by a specific artist.
2. Transforming images from one visual style to another (e.g., changing photos to look like Monet paintings).
3. Translating images from one medical modality to another, like MRI to CT scans.
